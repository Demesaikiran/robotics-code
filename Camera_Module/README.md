## Intro
This Repository is mainly about the camera codes for the Jetson Nano and Raspberry pi. In Jetson I've added the Auto Focus camera code and dual camera code where we can access the two camera pins at a time.


### To Run the AutoFocus run
`python3 Jetson/AutoFocus.py -i 6`

### To Run the Dual Camera code run
`python3 Jetson/dual_camera.py`
