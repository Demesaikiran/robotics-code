# Servo Codes

In this directory you will find the default servo code and servo codes for various DOF Robo-Arm.

## How to run the codes:
### **Flask based servo code:**
To run a flask based servo code, firstly you need to run the server code and then the client code. 

Firstly run the server code
```
python3 arm.py
```
Secondly run the client code
```
python3 client.py
```
Voila! You can now control the servo motors using the `<-` and `->` keys on the keyboard.
